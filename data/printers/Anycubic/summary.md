# Anycubic

Founded in 2015 by Mr. James Ouyang and Lu Ouyang.

After a whole year's hard work, the first model Anycubic Mega came on board in 2016. Fortunately our work paid off. Mega became so popular in the market in a short period of time and our journey as a professional 3D printer maker officially started.
